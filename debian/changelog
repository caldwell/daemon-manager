daemon-manager (0.98) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Upstream release:

    * Swapped command and daemon-id to match "service" param ordering.

    * Removed sockfile daemon.conf option.

    * Removed canonical name guessing based on prefix. It proved too
      temperamental and is better served by bash completion (which doesn't
      exist yet).

    * Added "log" and "tail" commands to view a daemon's log file with
      $PAGER/less/more/cat and "tail -f", respectively.

  * New upstream release:

    * Fix buffer overflow on long error messages.

    * Fix daemons' groups not getting set up right.

daemon-manager (0.96) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:

    * Fix reincarnation bug: don't re-daemonize on reincarnation.

  * Make the postinst, prerm, and init.d scripts use the HUP technique to
    re-exec the new binary.

daemon-manager (0.95) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:

    * SIGHUP now causes daemon-manager to re-exec itself, preserving its
      state. This means that new versions can be transitioned to without
      losing track of the daemons running under the old version.

    * [runs_as] config section is now [can_run_as]. The old one is
      deprecated. It works for now but warns.

    * Errors and warnings in daemon config files now show up when you use
      dmctl to mess with the daemon.

    * "dmctl" with no arguments now does "status" instead of "help".

    * Fixed dmctl response size limit of 1000 bytes (it's now unlimited).

    * Fixed daemons that failed to start looking like they were actually
      started.

    * Fixed users with bad home directories causing daemon-manager to spin
      and use 100% of the CPU.

daemon-manager (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
  
    * Print elapsed times better in "dmctl status".

    * Fix dmclt to work when abbreviated daemon name was the same as the user name.

    * Made some error messages clearer.

    * Fixed accept() not always working.

    * Internal code cleanups.
