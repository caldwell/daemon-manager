Description: Allow non-root users to start and stop their own daemons.
 Daemon Manager allows non-root users to start and stop their own
 daemons. It is perfect for running FastCGI servers, torrent servers, or any
 other daemon that isnâ€™t meant to run in the root context.
 .
 Daemon Manager will monitor processes and restart a daemon if it exits or
 crashes.
 .
 Daemon Manager allows the system administrator to decide which users can
 launch daemons and what users they are allowed to launch daemons as. For
 instance, it is common to launch FastCGI servers as a different user
 ("www-data" on Debian or Ubuntu, "apache" on Fedora).
 .
 Users are only allowed to see and control daemons which they have been
 given access to by the system administrator.
