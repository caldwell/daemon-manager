Daemon Manager
--------------

Daemon Manager allows non-root users to start and stop their own daemons. It
is perfect for running FastCGI servers, torrent servers, or any other daemon
that isn't meant to run in the root context.


Availability
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Daemon Manager will monitor processes and restart a daemon if it exits or
crashes.


Security
~~~~~~~~

Daemon Manager allows the system administrator to decide which users can
launch daemons and what users they are allowed to launch daemons as. For
instance, it is common to launch FastCGI servers as a different user
("www-data" on Debian or Ubuntu, "apache" on Fedora).

Users are only allowed to see and control daemons which they have been given
access to by the system administrator.


Similarities
~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are many other programs out there that manage daemons. Daemon Manager
has many similarities with upstart, systemd, supervise (daemon-tools), and
System V init scripts but it has a different feature set and is not designed
to replace any of those. Here are some similarities and differences:

    * Like upstart, systemd and supervise, Daemon Manager will respawn a
      daemon that exits prematurely.

    * Like standard system V init scripts, there are no dependencies.

    * Users can be given control of their own daemons. These daemons may run
      as the user or as any other user on the system (if the system
      administrator gives them permission).

    * Special users can be given control over other users daemons (think
      help desk operators at a hosting company).

    * Configuration is very simple. Daemon config files are generally 4
      lines or fewer in length.


Rationale
~~~~~~~~~

Daemon Manager was originally conceived as a way to keep track of the myriad
FastCGI servers on machines that host a number of heterogeneous web sites
using servers like Lighttpd and Nginx. It became obvious as work progressed
that the program wouldn't be specific to just FastCGI daemons, but that
there were many use cases for daemons that a user might want to run as
themselves (or another non-privileged user) and control themselves.
