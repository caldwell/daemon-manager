title: dmctl from unauthorized user is silent to that user
desc: |-
  From an dmctl just returns with no prints to stderr or stdout. Completely silent.
  Trying to duplicate this locally I get:
      dmctl: No response from daemon-manager: Connection reset by peer
  But on a clean raspbian install there was no message.
  Got this in the log:
      Jun 20 06:18:58 MichaelPi daemon-manager[23402]: [Warning] Command socket: Not authorized. "michaelc" (uid 1002) is not in the daemon-manager.conf file
