title: dmctl from unauthorized user is silent to that user
desc: |-
  Running as unauthorized user, dmctl just returns with no prints to stderr or stdout. Completely silent.
  Trying to duplicate this locally I get:
      dmctl: No response from daemon-manager: Connection reset by peer
  But on a clean raspbian install there was no message.
  Got this in the log:
      Jun 20 06:18:58 MichaelPi daemon-manager[23402]: [Warning] Command socket: Not authorized. "michaelc" (uid 1002) is not in the daemon-manager.conf file

    On Mac OS X I always get the messaage. On x86-64 Debian Linux I sometimes get:
      dmctl: No response from daemon-manager: Connection reset by peer
    
    The strace says this:
      write(3, "status ", 7)                  = 7
      poll([{fd=3, events=POLLIN}], 1, 4294967295) = 1 ([{fd=3, revents=POLLIN}])
      read(3, "ERR: Not authorized. \"nobody\" (u"..., 255) = 81
      read(3, 0x7fff429b3160, 255)            = -1 ECONNRESET (Connection reset by peer)
    
    So the loop has read the good data and just needs to spit it out (ignoring
    connection reset by peer in this case).
    
    On a Raspberry Pi install I'm getting this (once the SIGPIPE fix is
    installed):
      dmctl: Write to command fifo failed: Broken pipe
    
    The strace says this:
      write(3, "status ", 7)                  = -1 EPIPE (Broken pipe)
    
    So these problems are similar. In both cases it seems the server has spewed
    the error and closed the connection faster than dmctl is used to.
