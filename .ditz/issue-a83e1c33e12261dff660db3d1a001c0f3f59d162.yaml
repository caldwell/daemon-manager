title: Missing home directory cases super fast polling (bad fs in poll)
desc: |-
  This code:
          try {
              user_list.push_back(users[u] = new user(u));
              users[u]->create_dirs();
              users[u]->open_server_socket();
          } catch (std::exception &e) {
              log(LOG_WARNING, "Ignoring %s: %s\n", u.c_str(), e.what());
          }
  Is at fault. If open_server_socket() throws then the user is already in the user list.
  Later when we go through the list the we try to use the socket which isn't open and has
  random crap for the filehandle. This causes poll to fail and the main loop ends up polling
  with no delay, taking 100% of the CPU.
