title: Add env variables to conf files
desc: |-
  You can do it by putting the env vars on the start line, but that is ugly for more than 1.
  So maybe
  env MY_ENV=hello
  or just
  MY_ENV=hello
  IE, all uppercase means env var. But then what about lower case ones. I bet it'll turn up.
  maybe env_MY_ENV=hello
  or env:MY_ENV=hello
  That last one looks pretty clean (if a bit XML namespacey).

    commit 9cff4e84110c78d1ac361ea28f090978e7223c51 (HEAD, refs/heads/master)
    Author: David Caldwell <david@porkrind.org>

        Add "export var=value" syntax to daemon config for adding environment variables.
    
        You could do it previosuly by just sticking it on the "start" line like:
    
            start=DAVID=david RULES=rules exec echo $DAVID $RULES
    
        ...but that got real ugly when the environment variables started piling
        up. The new syntax looks much better:
    
            export DAVID=david
            export RULES=rules
            start=exec echo $DAVID $RULES
    
        Closes: #158357055b
