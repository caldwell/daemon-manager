title: Add env variables to conf files
desc: |-
  You can do it by putting the env vars on the start line, but that is ugly for more than 1.
  So maybe
  env MY_ENV=hello
  or just
  MY_ENV=hello
  IE, all uppercase means env var. But then what about lower case ones. I bet it'll turn up.
  maybe env_MY_ENV=hello
  or env:MY_ENV=hello
  That last one looks pretty clean (if a bit XML namespacey).
