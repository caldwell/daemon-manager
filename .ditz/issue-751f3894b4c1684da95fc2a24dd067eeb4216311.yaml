desc: |-
  Jim suggested it, I think it's a good idea.
  Possibly think about backward compatibility.

        runs_as -> can_run_as which reads better and makes the config less confusing (hopefully).
    
        [runs_as] remains for backwards compatibility but is not documented.

        [config.cc] Instead of silently accepting the old [runs_as], complain loudly in the log.
