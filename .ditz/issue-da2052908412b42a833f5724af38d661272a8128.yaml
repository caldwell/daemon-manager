title: Add support to logrotate (without copytruncate)
desc: |-
  To do this we'd need an extra fork and a little loop that copies stdin/stderr captures
  to a log file. That way we can HUP and re-open the log files.
  Or we could put the log file stuff in the main select loop and do the copies there.
  Could that cause daemon manager or dmctl to react slowly when there's heavy logging?
  If everything's ONONBLOCK then it shouldn't, I think... But probably worth testing.
