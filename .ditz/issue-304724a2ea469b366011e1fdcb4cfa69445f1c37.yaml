title: Clean install didn't create ~/.daemon-manager tree
desc: |-
  Here's a log:
      Jun 20 06:18:54 MichaelPi daemon-manager[23402]: [Warning] Ignoring michaelc: mkdir /home/michaelc/.daemon-manager/daemons failed: No such file or directory
      Jun 20 06:18:54 MichaelPi daemon-manager[23402]: [Error] root can't manage non-existant user "michaelc"
  
  Clearly there's a chicken and egg problem here.
  But if the user is listed in daemon-manager.conf then it should just create the dirs it needs.
