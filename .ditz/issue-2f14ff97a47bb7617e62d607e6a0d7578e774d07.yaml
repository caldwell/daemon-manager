title: Add ability to upgrade without losing track of daemons.
desc: |-
  The idea is that we exec() our new version so that we keep all of the child processes.
  The old code has to save its state and feed it to the new code somehow.
  It should probably do this in response to SIGHUP.
  Since it's re-exec()ing itself it'll also work for reloading its master config files.
