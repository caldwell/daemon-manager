daemon-manager (1.2.1)

  * Small documentation change: forgot to document the `edit` command in
    the `dmctl` man page.

daemon-manager (1.1.1)

  * Fix Makefile so installing into a empty DESTDIR works (thanks James Cook)

 -- David Caldwell <david@porkrind.org>  Tue, 02 Jun 2020 11:52:42 -0700

daemon-manager (1.1)

  * Added `kill` command to dmctl to send signals to daemons.

 -- David Caldwell <david@porkrind.org>  Fri, 08 Jun 2018 01:58:04 -0700

daemon-manager (1.0)

  * Fix deadlock in signal handler.

  * Fix race conditions that prevented error messages from displaying in
    dmctl.

 -- David Caldwell <david@porkrind.org>  Thu, 15 Oct 2015 19:06:36 -0700

daemon-manager (0.99.1)

  * Fix the bash completion code. Awk will be the death of me.

 -- David Caldwell <david@porkrind.org>  Sun, 09 Mar 2014 16:15:34 -0700

daemon-manager (0.99)

  * Replaced individual command sockets with a single one in /var/run.

  * Added "export ENV=value" syntax to daemon config file to set
    environment variables.

  * Added bash completion script.

 -- David Caldwell <david@porkrind.org>  Sat, 08 Mar 2014 16:47:53 -0800

daemon-manager (0.98)

  * Swapped command and daemon-id to match "service" param ordering.

  * Removed sockfile daemon.conf option.

  * Removed canonical name guessing based on prefix. It proved too
    temperamental and is better served by bash completion (which doesn't
    exist yet).

  * Added "log" and "tail" commands to view a daemon's log file with
    $PAGER/less/more/cat and "tail -f", respectively.

 -- David Caldwell <david@porkrind.org>  Sun, 14 Jul 2013 22:39:14 -0700

  * Fix daemons' groups not getting set up right.

 -- David Caldwell <david@porkrind.org>  Sun, 12 Aug 2012 15:18:25 -0700

daemon-manager (0.96)

  * Fix reincarnation bug: don't re-daemonize on reincarnation.

 -- David Caldwell <david@porkrind.org>  Sun, 13 Nov 2011 20:00:31 -0800

daemon-manager (0.95)

  * SIGHUP now causes daemon-manager to re-exec itself, preserving its
    state. This means that new versions can be transitioned to without
    losing track of the daemons running under the old version.

  * [runs_as] config section is now [can_run_as]. The old one is
    deprecated. It works for now but warns.

  * Errors and warnings in daemon config files now show up when you use
    dmctl to mess with the daemon.

  * "dmctl" with no arguments now does "status" instead of "help".

  * Fixed dmctl response size limit of 1000 bytes (it's now unlimited).

  * Fixed daemons that failed to start looking like they were actually
    started.

  * Fixed users with bad home directories causing daemon-manager to spin
    and use 100% of the CPU.

 -- David Caldwell <david@porkrind.org>  Sun, 13 Nov 2011 16:40:51 -0800

daemon-manager (0.9)

  * Print elapsed times better in "dmctl status".

  * Fixed dmclt to work when abbreviated daemon name was the same as the
    user name.

  * Made some error messages clearer.

  * Fixed accept() not always working.

  * Internal code cleanups.

 -- David Caldwell <david@porkrind.org>  Mon, 07 Feb 2011 16:36:27 -0800

daemon-manager (0.8)

  * First public release
