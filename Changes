daemon-manager (0.95)

  * SIGHUP now causes daemon-manager to re-exec itself, preserving its
    state. This means that new versions can be transitioned to without
    losing track of the daemons running under the old version.

  * [runs_as] config section is now [can_run_as]. The old one is
    deprecated. It works for now but warns.

  * Errors and warnings in daemon config files now show up when you use
    dmctl to mess with the daemon.

  * "dmctl" with no arguments now does "status" instead of "help".

  * Fixed dmctl response size limit of 1000 bytes (it's now unlimited).

  * Fixed daemons that failed to start looking like they were actually
    started.

  * Fixed users with bad home directories causing daemon-manager to spin
    and use 100% of the CPU.

    user name.
